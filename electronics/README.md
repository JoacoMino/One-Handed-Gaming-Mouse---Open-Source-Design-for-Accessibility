# Electronics

This folder contains the PCB designs and schematics for the project.

## Included files

- **main-board.sch / .pcb**: Main PCB with the SparkFun Pro Micro, PMW3360 sensor, and connectors.
- **matrix-board.sch / .pcb**: PCB for the 3Ã—4 matrix of mechanical key switches.

## Manufacturing

These PCBs were designed using KiCAD and ordered from a factory in China. Assembly requires:

- Soldering hotswap sockets for key switches.
- Soldering diodes (1N4007 DC) on the matrix board.
- Installing the SparkFun Pro Micro and PMW3360 sensor.

## Components

- 1 SparkFun Pro Micro
- 1 PMW3360 optical sensor module
- 11 Mechanical key switches
- 11 Hotswap sockets
- 11 Diodes 1N4007 DC
- JST connectors for modular assembly
